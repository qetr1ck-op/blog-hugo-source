Webpack simplifies web development by solving a fundamental problem: bundling. It takes in various assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and then transforms these assets into a format thatâ€™s convenient to consume through a browser. Doing this well takes away a significant amount of pain from web development.

It's not the easiest tool to learn due to its configuration-driven approach, but it's incredibly powerful. The purpose of this guide is to help you get started with webpack and then to go beyond the basics.
